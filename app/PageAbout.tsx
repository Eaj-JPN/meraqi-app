            Anand and Heena co-founded Meraqi together in the year 2014. Started
            out from a small Martabak Stall, they both shared the love to create
            something meaningful than just selling food. There was so much
            dedication and energy that they put together to create a single
            recipe.

            Soon they found a home for their next adventure, Hause Rooftop. This
            oasis sits a special place in the hear of the co-founders, hence the
            name Heena & Anandâ€™s House, in short Hause. A lot of Love and
            Passion was put into this, with no background in hospitality, they
            thrive to make the place grow and become one of the rooftop icon in
            Jakarta. Many more adventures continued from here, a rollercoaster
            ride that resulted in open and close down of few ventures. Which
            only add to more learning and growth through out the process.
